# Financial Mathematics - European Option Pricing and Hedging

For my final project in Financial Mathematics, I developed an interactive European Option Pricing and Hedging Calculator using R Shiny. This app implements the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the price of European call and put options, as well as the associated Greek hedging metrics (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho).

## Key features include:

 - User Inputs: Allows users to input key parameters such as the underlying asset price, exercise price, interest rate, time to expiration, and volatility.
 - Real-Time Calculations: The app calculates the option prices and Greek hedges dynamically based on user inputs, providing insights into how option prices and risks change with different market conditions.
 - Hedging Strategies: Displays Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho for both call and put options, aiding in risk management strategies.

This project showcases my skills in financial modeling, derivatives pricing, and building interactive data-driven applications.
